# Discovery

## Inventory Highlights (2025-09-25)
- ✅ Lint, typecheck, unit/integration, and Playwright suites all pass locally with enforced coverage thresholds (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test:coverage`, `pnpm e2e`).
- ✅ Health (`/api/healthz`) and readiness (`/api/readyz`) probes implemented; Dockerfile and docker-compose expose healthy non-root runtime.
- ✅ `.env.example` updated with all required variables plus testing overrides; README, CHANGELOG, MIGRATION, release notes, and REPORT scaffolded.
- ✅ CI workflow now runs lint → typecheck → coverage → build → Playwright with artifact uploads.
- ✅ Build artifacts produced via containerized `pnpm build` and zipped to `dist/techguardlk-v0.2.0-rc.2.zip` (standalone output) for release packaging.

## Test Baseline
- Vitest unit + integration suites cover auth, profile, checkout, rate limiting, audit, utilities.
- Playwright e2e specs exercise marketing and auth flows with axe-core scans; HTML report stored in `e2e-report/`.

## Risks & Gaps
- Admin UI accessibility and complex client-side state remain lightly tested (deferred).
- Live Stripe webhook validation still recommended before GA (documented in REPORT).

# Execution Tracker

## Critical to Ship
1. **Hardening & Deployment Readiness** – ✅ Completed  
   - Added probe endpoints, non-root Docker runtime, docker-compose health checks, and expanded `.env.example` guidance.
2. **Backend Coverage & Security Validation** – ✅ Completed  
   - Added Vitest integration suites with mocked Prisma/Stripe/email, rate-limit reset helper, and coverage thresholds (lines ≥91%).
3. **Frontend Behaviour & Accessibility Tests** – ✅ Completed  
   - Expanded Playwright suite (marketing/auth) with axe-core; improved landing header contrast and nav semantics.
4. **CI & Reporting Improvements** – ✅ Completed  
   - Hardened `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, persisted coverage, Playwright, and build artifacts; updated REPORT with metrics.
5. **Documentation & Release Artifacts** – ✅ Completed  
   - Refreshed README with architecture diagram, deployment guide; updated CHANGELOG/MIGRATION; generated release notes, REPORT, and zipped build artifact.

## Nice to Have
1. **Performance Budget & Monitoring Hooks** – ⏳ Deferred  
   - Added to REPORT as follow-up; no direct instrumentation this cycle.
2. **Developer Experience Enhancements** – ✅ Completed  
   - Added pnpm scripts for targeted tests/coverage/e2e CI; documented local tooling in README.
3. **Admin UX Polishing** – ⏳ Deferred  
   - Logged as future work; current release focuses on backend hardening and testing.

## Upcoming Actions
- Completed release tagging (`v0.2.0-rc.2`), published artifacts, and validated Docker Compose deployment with passing health/ready probes.
- Ensure deployment targets configure health probes to `/api/healthz` and `/api/readyz`.
