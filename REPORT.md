# Project Report

## Executive Summary
- Delivered `/api/healthz` and `/api/readyz` plus hardened Docker assets so orchestrators gain first-class health probes.
- Raised automated quality bars: Vitest integration suites now cover auth, profile, checkout, and infrastructure helpers (lines 91.55%, branches 80.15%); Playwright adds marketing/auth smoke tests with axe-core scans.
- Refreshed developer experience with updated README, coverage-aware CI workflow, release collateral, and a zipped standalone production build artifact ready for distribution.

## Quality Metrics (2025-09-25)
- `pnpm lint` → ✅ (no warnings)
- `pnpm typecheck` → ✅
- `pnpm test:coverage` → ✅ (lines 91.55%, branches 80.15%, functions 96.66%, statements 91.55%; report lives in `coverage/`)
- `pnpm e2e` → ✅ (5 specs passing; HTML report at `e2e-report/index.html`)
- `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true NEXTAUTH_SECRET=test-secret DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/techguard?schema=public pnpm build` → ✅ (artifacts zipped under `dist/`)

## Accessibility & Performance
- Landing header contrast and nav semantics tuned to satisfy WCAG 2.1 AA; verified via axe-core scans in `tests/e2e/marketing.spec.ts`.
- Playwright suite captures accessibility regressions via `@axe-core/playwright`; no violations detected on marketing/auth pages.
- Lighthouse budget to be captured post-deployment; documented follow-up in Risks.

## Security & Compliance
- Integration tests assert rate limiting for signup, password reset, and checkout endpoints; `resetRateLimitStore` exposed for deterministic tests.
- Health endpoints avoid leaking sensitive data and are safe for external probes.
- REPORT documents outstanding work for live Stripe webhook validation.

## Deliverables
- `README.md` (quick start, scripts, architecture diagram, deployment guide)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog – release `0.2.0-rc.2`)
- `MIGRATION.md` (no schema changes)
- `PLAN.md` (discovery + execution tracker updated)
- `REPORT.md` (this document)
- `release/notes.md` (draft for `v0.2.0-rc.2`)
- `dist/techguardlk-v0.2.0-rc.2.zip` (production build package)
- Test artifacts: `coverage/`, `e2e-report/`

## Open Risks & Follow-ups
- Admin UI components still need deeper accessibility review (focus traps, keyboard ordering).
- Stripe webhook flow should be validated against a live Stripe listener before GA launch.
- Future sprint should add client-side component tests for complex dashboards.

## Next Steps
1. Stage and commit the changes, then tag `v0.2.0-rc.2` once code review completes.
2. Publish the tag and artifacts (coverage, e2e report, `dist/` zip) via CI or release tooling.
3. Configure production health probes to `/api/healthz` (liveness) and `/api/readyz` (readiness) and provision env vars as outlined in the README.
